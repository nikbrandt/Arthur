Arthur - Another one of those bots that does things. It has an active developer, at least for now. He'll probably respond to anything you ask him within a short amount of time.

Arthur does have some hot features that other bots don't, but not that many. To list a few, `mp3` which downloads and converts YouTube videos to mp3, and `webshot` which takes a full-length shot of a website. And I think the leveling system is pretty damn nice, but who knows. More features are always being added, just wait a while because the developer is very slow to add things.

I guess the overall point of this is that Arthur is like a nice multipurpose bot. Yeah.

Eh, we're going back to using an MIT license, I feel weird having contributors but still being under copyright. To get this bot up and running, you'll probably need to add quite a lot of files to a `../media` directory, and since I'm not *really* trying to decentralize this bot, that challenge is up to you.

PRs, issues, complaints, whatever, all welcome. You can also complain in the support server above.
